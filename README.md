# Environmental Justice Research Repository. 
Developed and used as research source data for the Spring 2022 University of Oregon ENG 470 Technologies and Text Capstone Course


# About the Project
This digital collection serves as a repository of research materials related to the history of environmental racism in the Eugene-Springfield community. In consultation with the nonprofit organization Beyond Toxics, students and faculty at the University of Oregon are working to collect and catalog primary sources related to the formal and informal segregation of housing, education, and outdoor recreation opportunities in our city.

We aim to better understand the ways predominantly white institutions have systematically shifted environmental hazards onto communities of color and how these communities have organized and advocated around issues of environmental justice.

## About the Dataset
The collection brings together reports, policy documents, maps, newspaper clippings, newsletters, museum exhibit catalogs, curricular materials, academic research, and demographic data that together shed light on our local history and its relationship to events and trends at the state, regional, and national level. These materials come from city, state, and federal government websites; UO Libraries digital collections; the Lane County History Museum Archives; and publicly available sources.

## Intellectual Property Rights
The materials in this collection are gathered here for educational and not-for-profit research purposes. The project team has either received explicit permission to include these materials in the collection or has completed a fair use evaluation for its use. The team has also made a good-faith effort to determine and record rights information about each primary source in the item-level metadata. Users who wish to reuse sources from this collection should verify independently the copyright status of each item and contact the rights holder directly for reuse permission. Content developed specifically for this website is copyrighted by the University of Oregon under the terms of an agreement with the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and is published under a Creative Commons-BY-ND-NC license.

Land Acknowledgment
It is impossible to address environmental racism in our community without recognizing the Indigenous people who have stewarded these lands and waters since time immemorial. The cities of Eugene and Springfield and the University of Oregon are situated on the traditional homelands of the Kalapuya people, whom the U.S. Government forcibly removed to the Coast Reservation in Western Oregon following the Willamette Valley Treaty of 1855. Today, Kalapuya people’s descendents are citizens of the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde Community of Oregon and the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians. We express our respect for them and for all federally recognized Tribal Nations of Oregon–including the Burns Paiute Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, the Coquille Indian Tribe, the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians, and the Klamath Tribes–and for all other displaced Indigenous peoples who call Kalapuya Ilihi home.

## Harmful Content Statement
This digital collection includes digitized archival materials that document traumatic histories and violent ideologies.

Some of these materials use offensive language, express biased or hateful views, and perpetuate harmful stereotypes, particularly with respect to race, color, national origin, ethnicity, and socioeconomic class. In addition, some of the descriptive metadata used to catalog these materials is inherited from predominantly white institutions where communities of color have historically had less access and privilege, and therefore less control over their own representation.

The Eugene-Springfield community and the University of Oregon continue to reflect and to be structured by these histories, and our project team is not immune to bias or prejudice. We are actively working to remediate, re-process, and re-contextualize these objects as source material for anti-racist digital storytelling projects that might eventually play a small role in repairing some of these harms.


# CollectionBuilder
## Build a Digital Collection! 

Check out the [CollectionBuilder docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/) for how to get started, or visit the [CollectionBuilder home](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) for more information.

If you are interested in using CollectionBuilder, or are already using it, please drop us a line (**libstatic.uidaho@gmail.com**) since we would love to learn more about it's use in the wild. 
There are also currently opportunities to [collaborate on CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/about.html#the-grant).

`collectionbuilder-gh` is intended as a simple template for hands-on teaching about digital libraries.
It can be used in a workshop setting to take participants through digitization and metadata creation, to having a live collection site hosted on GitHub.

`collectionbuilder-gh` aims to be well documented and easy to configure by following the example, with the potential to scaffold learning of a multitude of transferable digital and data skills.
A project in "minimal computing", it provides a depth of learning opportunities, allowing users to take complete ownership over the project and make their work open to the world.

Learn about:

- Git and GitHub basics
- [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), plaintext writing and content creation
- HTML, CSS, and JS literacy
- commandline literacy
- GitHub collaboration and project management
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) basics
- working in the Open, open source and open data
- digital libraries concepts such as "collections as data", minimal computing, data-driven design

> We prefer commonly understood formats (such as CSV spreadsheets over YAML), and convention over configuration (follow the example over learn all the options).

## Features

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for GitHub Pages 
- Layout using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/).
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- Mapping using [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/)
