The purpose of the notice seems to be to laud the Gilhams for not participating in a campaign to force Black families out of their neighborhood, and it uses offensive language, suggesting that it may be a remediation of older materials on file in the records of the Gillespie Cemetary, where Gilham was buried in 1958. The notice was included in an email from Linda Ague to a correspondent seeking information about Gilham and was printed out and highlighted for inclusion in the Reynolds Family Collection at Lane County History Museum, presumably because of its reference to Leo and Pearl Washington and the demolition of Tent City.
